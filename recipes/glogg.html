    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>“In Sweden the holiday season revolves around one beverage: glögg,”
        says chef Marcus Samuelsson. “Seemingly every single meal during 
        the month of December begins (and ends) with a glass (or three) 
        of this warm ruby red <strong>mulled wine</strong>. When I was growing up, 
        the moment my grandmother started to cook up a batch on her 
        stove signaled that the festivities were about to begin. 
        I knew that delicious spreads of baked hams, herring prepared 
        in a variety of ways, lutfisk, and gubbröra would be landing on 
        the dining room table in no time. Oh, and I was amped to realize 
        that it wouldn’t be long until I’d receive some Christmas presents 
        too.” Packed with cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger, get ready for 
        your entire home to be infused with the scent of the holidays.
